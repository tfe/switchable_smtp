[`switchable_smtp`](http://github.com/tfe/switchable_smtp/)
========

You shouldn't have to re-deploy your application in order to switch SMTP servers, which you may want to do if your provider goes down or starts acting funny, or if you start bumping up against usage limits. This plugin allows you to switch your SMTP settings on the fly. You can even specify them on a per-mail basis if you need that kind of control.


Installation
------------

    script/plugin install git://github.com/tfe/switchable_smtp.git


Usage
-----

The plugin adds a `custom_smtp` instance variable and method to `ActionMailer::Base` (to support the old and new way of configuring ActionMailer). To specify different SMTP settings for a mailing, just call this when setting up the mail:

    class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
      def message(message)
        @recipients = "someone@example.com"
        @subject    = "Test"
        @from       = "noreply@example.com"
    
        @body[:message] = message
    
        @custom_smtp = {
          :address => "smtp.sendgrid.net",
          :user_name => "noreply@example.com",
          :password => "secret",
          :domain=>"example.com",
          :port => "25",
          :authentication => :plain
        }
      end
    end

Of course, you'll probably be fetching your custom SMTP settings hash out of the database or something, otherwise there's not much point in using this plugin. On my apps, I'm using the [`rails-settings`](http://github.com/Squeegy/rails-settings) gem to keep my settings in the database, then I just do

    @custom_smtp = Settings.active_smtp

swapping the active SMTP settings back and forth as necessary.

This is pretty much straight out of 
[this blog post](http://blog.flvorful.com/articles/2009/12/20/deep-in-rails-actionmailer-deliver-part-vi) 
by Jake Varghese. I've just pluginized it and provided some guidelines for using it within your app.
